OpenDocument Thumbnail Creator
================================

KDE thumbnail-plugin that generates small images (thumbnails)
for ODF (OpenDocument Format) files, to be displayed, for example,
on Konqueror and Dolphin file managers.


DEPENDENCIES
`````````````
The following libraries and development packages are needed:
KDE >=4.2.x
QT  >=4.4.x


INSTALLATION
`````````````
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ..         <- DON'T forget ..
     make
     su -c 'make install'
     kbuildsycoca4

Because KOffice's own thumbnail-plugin supports the same
mime-types, you may (== untested) need to disable/remove
/usr/lib/kde4/kofficethumbnail.so
/usr/share/kde4/services/kofficethumbnail.desktop
